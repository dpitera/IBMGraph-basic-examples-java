# IBMGraph-basic-examples-java

Here is a very basic Maven Project that you can use to understand the basic types of operations that [IBM Graph](https://ibm-graph-docs.ng.bluemix.net/index.html) supports. 

You can `clone` the source code and import it into eclipse as an existing Maven project. Then you should be able to run `IBMGraphExampleJava.java`. 

Note: You must first [provision an instance of IBM graph](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-graph/) and update the code with your personal credentials.
